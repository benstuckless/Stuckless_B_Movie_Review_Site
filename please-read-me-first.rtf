Project By:	Ben Stuckless
Project Name:	Movie Review Site
Project Description:	For this assignment, I created a basic looking website with a lot of functionality.  For example, you can view information
about movies that is being pulled from a database.  You can watch movie trailers, with custom javascript controls, that are being pulled from a database as well.
You can add comments to the database, and if you click on a comment block after you comment you can view your comment.  Also, the site allows you to
filter the movies based on genres and search movies with the built in live search.
